# MediPath

MediPath is a role-based healthcare web application built with React and Vite for patients, doctors, and administrators. It combines symptom-driven doctor discovery, live queue handling, prescription workflows, medication tracking, recovery guidance, and emergency support in one streamlined interface.

## Overview

The app is designed as a connected care journey:

- Patients select symptoms and get matched to suitable doctors.
- Admins manage incoming queue requests and assign appointment slots.
- Doctors create prescriptions, set medicine timings, and attach recovery guidance.
- Patients then follow medication schedules, receive reminder support, and continue into recovery plans.

## Core Features

### Patient experience

- Category-based symptom picker with support for custom symptom input
- Ranked doctor recommendations with match score, fee, availability, rating, city, and experience
- Real-time queue status tracking after joining a doctor's queue
- Medication dashboard with active prescription syncing from Firestore
- Dose-by-dose medicine tracking with daily compliance progress
- Browser notification reminders for scheduled medicine times
- Recovery section with diet guidance, exercise checklist, and video-based rehab content
- Built-in SOS flow with emergency helpline references for South Asian regions

### Doctor experience

- Role-based doctor login and onboarding
- Prescription creation with patient details, diagnosis, symptoms, dosage, and course duration
- Medication timing setup for reminder-driven treatment plans
- Recovery and diet plan authoring for post-treatment care
- Video recommendation selection for patient recovery support
- Prototype chat panel for patient follow-up style interactions

### Admin experience

- Appointment slot assignment for waiting patients
- Recently scheduled appointments view
- Doctor workload panel showing active waiting counts
- Demo prescription generation to unlock downstream patient flow during testing

## Product Flow

### Patient journey

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- Vite 7
- React Router 7
- Firebase Authentication
- Cloud Firestore
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Lucide React

## Data and App Logic

- Uses a seeded synthetic doctor database spanning multiple specialties
- Includes structured symptom-to-specialty mappings for doctor recommendations
- Supports role-based routing for `patient`, `doctor`, and `admin`
- Uses live Firestore listeners for queue updates and active prescriptions
- Tracks in-progress treatment state with a mix of Firestore and local storage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pb3363-art/medipath.git
cd medipath
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server will start locally and the app will be available in the browser.

## Environment Variables

The repository includes an example environment file:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-your_measurement_id
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` when wiring your own Firebase project.

Note: the current codebase also contains Firebase configuration in [`src/lib/firebase.js`](/d:/medipath/src/lib/firebase.js), so you may want to move that fully to environment-based config if you are preparing the app for production.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - start the local development server
- `npm run build` - create a production build
- `npm run preview` - preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` - run ESLint

## Deployment

Deployment configuration is already included for:

- Vercel
- Netlify

See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](/d:/medipath/DEPLOYMENT.md) for deployment steps and hosting notes.

## Documentation

- [`ROADMAP.md`](/d:/medipath/ROADMAP.md) for planned product direction
- [`TIMELINE.md`](/d:/medipath/TIMELINE.md) for milestone history
- [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](/d:/medipath/DEPLOYMENT.md) for deployment setup

## Current Status

MediPath is currently a frontend-heavy prototype with live Firebase-backed workflows for authentication, queue handling, prescriptions, and medication tracking. It already demonstrates the complete multi-role app journey and is a strong base for production hardening, backend expansion, and deeper clinical integrations.
